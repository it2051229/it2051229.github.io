    <h4>Are you related to SeedIn?</h4>
    <p>
        No, just like you we are fellow investors in SeedIn. We are not in any way working for SeedIn 
        nor have connection with the employees of SeedIn.
    </p> 
    <h4>Why build this application?</h4>
    <p>
        For some, SeedIn's dashboard makes it difficult to keep track and sort investments. Some 
        opted to create their own excel sheets, some used calendar apps, some used their own custom 
        database, and some used reminder apps to keep track of their investments. Each and everyone 
        of us have questions with regards to our investments which SeedIn's dashboard cannot answer 
        directly. We decided to create our personalized way of tracking investment to make things 
        easier and clearer for us. After all, we all need to do due diligence and be in sync with what's going on with our funds.
    </p>
    <p>
        We decided to make it public and share with other SeedIn investors as well and might give value to them.
    </p>

    <h4>Do you keep my data?</h4>
    <p>
        No, all your data are private and locally stored on your web browser. We do not
        keep your data in our servers. 
    </p>
    <h4>Can I keep my data?</h4>
    <p>
        Yes, you can export your data. It will be extracted from your computer and downloaded
        as a file. You can then import the file through this app if you need
        to continue working on it later on.
    </p>
    <h4>What else do I need to know before using this app?</h4>
    <p>
        This project is a work in progress. There might be changes and improvements
        anytime so you should use it at your own risk. We recommend to backup your
        data frequently.
    </p> 
    <p>
        If you're looking for some feature that this app does not provide, feel free 
        to shoot us a message at <a href="mailto:contact@it2051229.com">contact@it2051229.com</a>.
        We'll see if it's something we can possibly add.
